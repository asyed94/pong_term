echo "==========================================="

echo "This test demonstrates the improved input handling."
echo ""
echo "BEFORE THE FIX:"
echo "- Only the last key event in each frame was processed"
echo "- Rapid key presses or holding keys resulted in laggy controls"
echo "- Terminal key repeat delay caused annoying pauses"
echo ""
echo "AFTER THE FIX (Current Implementation):"
echo "- All key events in the input buffer are accumulated"
echo "- Multiple events are consolidated using a bitmask approach"
echo "- No double-counting: pressing 'W' multiple times = one UP movement"
echo "- Smoother, more responsive controls at 60 FPS"
echo ""
echo "To test the improvements:"
echo "1. Run 'cargo run'"
echo "2. Press SPACE to start the game"
echo "3. Try holding W/S or arrow keys - paddles move smoothly"
echo "4. Try rapid tapping - no input lag or dropped events"
echo ""
echo "Technical Details:"
echo "- InputState struct accumulates all inputs per frame"
echo "- Bitmask prevents double-counting of same key"
echo "- All buffered inputs processed, not just the last one"

read -p "Press Enter to see the code changes..."

echo ""
echo "Key changes made:"
echo ""
echo "1. Replaced InputEvent enum with InputState struct:"
echo "   - Contains boolean flags for each input type"
echo "   - Accumulates all events in a frame"
echo ""
echo "2. Updated poll_input() function:"
echo "   - Accumulates all key events from buffer"
echo "   - Returns consolidated InputState"
echo ""
echo "3. Modified game loop input handling:"
echo "   - Processes all active inputs in InputState"
echo "   - Handles simultaneous inputs correctly"
echo ""
echo "Run 'cargo run' to test the improved controls!"
